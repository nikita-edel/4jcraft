THE REPO GOT NUKED, THE OTHER REPO GOT DMCA'd this is whats left
---

4JCraft is a modified version of the Minecraft Console Legacy Edition, aimed at porting old Minecraft to different platforms (such as Linux, Android, Emscripten, etc.) and refactoring the codebase to improve organization and use modern C++ features.

## Scope & Platform Support

At the moment, we're aiming to support the following platforms:

Please note that these percentages are **estimates** and do not necessarily reflect the final playability of the game on each platform.

- Linux (~85%)
- Emscripten (~10%) [[Check the Emscripten Branch](https://github.com/4jcraft/4jcraft/tree/feat/emscripten)]
- macOS (not started) [No official support but people have been able to run the game on MacOS]
- iOS (not started)
- Android (~5%)

> [!WARNING]
> There is NO Windows support, for that, go to [smartcmd/MinecraftConsoles](https://github.com/smartcmd/MinecraftConsoles/). 

> All efforts are focused towards a native Linux port, OpenGL rendering pipeline, and modernizing the existing LCE codebase/tooling to make future platform ports easier.
> 
> `Windows64` and other platforms originally supported by LCE are currently unsupported, since the original Visual Studio tooling has been stripped from this repository and replaced with our own.

## Building (Linux)

### Dependencies

Install the following packages before building (Debian/Ubuntu names shown):

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libsdl2-dev libgl-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libpthread-stubs0-dev
```

#### Arch/Manjaro

```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel gcc pkgconf cmake sdl2-compat mesa glu
```

#### Fedora/Red Hat/Nobara

```bash
sudo dnf in gcc gcc-c++ make cmake SDL2-devel mesa-libGL-devel mesa-libGLU-devel openssl-devel
```

#### Docker

If you don't want to deal with installing dependencies, you can use the included devcontainer. Open the project in VS Code with the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension and it will set everything up for you - GCC 15, Meson, Ninja, lld, and all the libraries.

Alternatively, you can build and use the container manually:

```bash
docker build -t 4jcraft-dev .devcontainer/
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/workspaces/4jcraft -w /workspaces/4jcraft 4jcraft-dev bash
```

### Configure & Build

This project uses the [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) build system (with [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)).

#### Install Tooling

Follow [this Quickstart guide](https://mesonbuild.com/Quick-guide.html) for installing or building Meson and Ninja on your respective distro.

#### Configure & Build

```bash
# 1. Configure a build directory (we'll name it `build`)
meson setup build

# 2. Compile the project
meson compile -C build
```

> [!TIP]
>
> For the fastest compilation speeds, you may want to use the compilers and linkers provided by an [LLVM toolchain](https://llvm.org/) (`clang`/`lld`) over your system compiler and linker. To do this, install `clang` and `lld`, and configure your build using the `llvm_native.txt` nativescript in `/scripts`:
>
> ```bash
> meson setup --native-file ./scripts/llvm_native.txt build
> ```
>
> ...or if you've already configured a build directory:
>
> ```bash
> meson setup --native-file ./scripts/llvm_native.txt build --reconfigure
> ```

The binary is output to:

```
./build/Minecraft.Client/Minecraft.Client
```

#### Clean

To perform a clean compilation:

```bash
meson compile --clean -C build
```

...or to reconfigure an existing build directory:

```bash
meson setup build --reconfigure 
```

...or to hard reset the build directory:

```bash
rm -r ./build
meson setup build
```

---

## Running

In order to run the compiled binary, you have a compiled copy of the game's assets in your current working directory. These assets are automatically copied to the `Minecraft.Client` folder in your build directory. To run the game, your current working directory must be in this folder.

```sh
cd build/Minecraft.Client
./Minecraft.Client
```
